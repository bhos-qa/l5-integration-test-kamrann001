## What is Integration Testing?
**Integration testing** is the process of inspecting various parts or units of a software project to reveal flaws and ensure that they function as intended.

## Why should we use It?

**Integration testing** is useful since it ensures that integrated components (like our API connectors) function as intended. Additionally, it facilitates component communication with third-party programs or APIs. Given that it covers a sizable percentage of the system, it is a useful alternative.

- You need to give execute permission for gradlew:

```chmod +x gradlew```

- And build and run the test
